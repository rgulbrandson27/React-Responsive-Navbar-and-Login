This project has taught me how important it is to design code that not only does what you want it to for the moment, but also to make sure there are no "unintended consequences" in the future.  

For example: After collapsing the screen and viewing the new menu, it only goes back to the original view if I close out of the menu using the "x" first. Otherwise, there is a little mess, including a hidden hamburger menu blending in with the white backgound (which I thank dev tools for showing me).  If I close out the menu first before going back to a wider view, it will work just fine.  It brings up the concept of thinking about what the user will do, or could do.  

This will be a fun one to come back to and get fixed.  I'm thinking it's something simple, but it will be interesting to see if that's the case.
