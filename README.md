This project has taught me how important it is to design code that not only does what you want it to, but also to make sure it doesn't do what you might want it to later on.
For example: In this project, after viewing the collapsable menu, if I widen the screen back to its original size, it only looks like it is supposed to if I click on the "x" first before widening.  Otherwise, there is a little mess, including a hidden hamburger menu blending in with the white.  If I close the menu first and then widen, it looks like it's supposed to.  
This will be a fun one to come back and figure out what I assume is something simple.
